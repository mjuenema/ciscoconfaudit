! Secure router configuration template.
! Version 6.5
! @(#)Secure IOS template v6.5 19 MAY 2014 Team Cymru noc@cymru.com
! @(#)https://www.cymru.com/Documents/secure-ios-template-65.html
!
! This configuration assumes the following topology:
!
! Upstream/Internet
! 192.0.2.1/28
!       |
! 192.0.2.14/28 (Ethernet 2/0)
! THIS ROUTER
! 192.0.2.17/28 (Ethernet 2/1)
!       |
! 192.0.2.30/28
! Firewall
! 192.0.2.33/27
!       |
! 192.0.2.32/27
! Intranet
!
! In this case, 192.0.2.34 is the loghost, FTP server, etc.
! for the router. It could also be the firewall if
! circumstances dictate.
!
service nagle
service tcp-keepalives-in
service tcp-keepalives-out
!
! Show copious timestamps in our logs
service timestamps debug datetime msec show-timezone localtime
service timestamps log datetime msec show-timezone localtime
! Ensures all passwords and secrets are obfuscated when looking at
! configuration files
service password-encryption
no service dhcp
!

boot system flash slot0:rsp-pv-mz.121-5a.bin

no logging console
! The keyword 'secret' ensures MD5 is used when 'service password
! encryption' is used (above.) The keyword 'password' uses a mechanism
! which is simple to reverse-engineer and should be avoided
enable secret <PASSWORD>
no enable password
!
! Use TACACS+ for AAA. Ensure that the local account is
! case-sensitive, thus making brute-force attacks less
! effective.
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local-case
aaa authentication enable default group tacacs+ enable
aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+ local
aaa accounting exec default stop-only group tacacs+
aaa accounting commands 15 default stop-only group tacacs+
aaa accounting network default stop-only group tacacs+
tacacs-server host 192.0.2.34
tacacs-server key cheezit
!
! In the event that TACACS+ fails, use case-sensitve local
! authentication instead. Keeps the hackers guessing, and
! the router more secure.
username <USERNAME> secret <PASSWORD>
!
! Logging the commands run while at enable level access is
! a great way to track mistakes, security issues, etc.
archive
 log config
  logging enable
  logging size 500
  notify syslog

! Ensure TCL doesn't use an initilizaion file where available. This won't show up in the
! config. It will break your router-based TCL scripts if
! if you use such, so use with care!
no scripting tcl init
no scripting tcl encdir
!
! Enable the netflow top talkers feature.
! You can see the top N talkers (50 in this example) with the
! show ip flow top-talkers command. This is a handy
! utility to use during DDoS attacks and traffic issues. You
! can sort-by either packets or bytes, as you prefer.
ip flow-top-talkers
 top 50
 sort-by packets
!
! Don't run the HTTP server.
no ip http server
no ip http secure-server
!
! Allow us to use the low subnet and go classless
ip subnet-zero
ip classless
!
! Disable noxious services
no service pad
no ip source-route
no ip finger
no ip bootp server
no ip domain-lookup
!
! Block brute force login attempts while maintaining access for legitimate source addresses.

! This is in theory unnecessary if VTY ACLs are in place, yet things happen and this adds the
! "belt" to the VTY ACL "suspenders."
! Note carefully the use of ACL 100 in the login quiet-mode statement. This ensures our
! legitimate administrator addresses can still reach the router even after a vigorous
! bruteforce or attack attempt.
login block-for 100 attempts 15 within 100

! Catch crash dumps; very important with a "security router."
ip ftp username rooter
ip ftp password <PASSWORD>
! Give our core dump files a unique name.
exception core-file secure-router01-core
exception protocol ftp
exception dump 192.0.2.34

! Fire up CEF for both performance and security.
ip cef
!
! Set the timezone properly. It is best to standardize on one
! timezone for all routers, thus making problem tracking easier.
clock timezone GMT 0
! Synchronize our clocks with a local (trusted and authenticated)
! NTP server. The SECRETKEY must be the same on both the router
! and the NTP server.
ntp authentication-key 6767 md5 <SECRETKEY>
ntp authenticate
ntp update-calendar
ntp server 192.0.2.34
!
! Configure the loopback0 interface as the source of our log
! messages. This is often used for routing protocols as well.
! Select an IP address that uniquely identifies this router.
! One trick is to allocate a netblock for use as the router
! loopback netblock.

 ! Don't send unreachables.
 ! NOTE WELL that this may break PMTU discovery.
 ! For example, if this router is edge for a VPN of any sort, you might need
 ! to enable ip unreachables
 ! A typical symptom is ping working but a larger transmission doesn't.

 ! Keep flow data for analysis. If possible, export it to a
 ! cflowd server.
 ip route-cache flow
 ! When you configure anything to do with ntp on an IOS box, it will start listening on all

 ! and therefore don't show a socket, unless that is what the interface is intended to do.

! Bogons
! Team Cymru has removed all static bogon references from this template
! due to the high probability that the application of these bogon filters
! will be a one-time event. Unfortunately many of these templates are
! applied and never re-visited, despite our dire warnings that bogons do
! change.
!
! This doesn't mean bogon filtering can't be accomplished in an automated
! manner. Why not consider peering with our globally distributed bogon
! route-server project? Alternately you can obtain a current and well
! maintained bogon feed from our DNS and RADb services. Read more at the
! link below to learn how!

! With the ACLs, it is important to log the naughty folks.
! Thus, the implicit drop all ACL is replaced (augmented,
! actually) with an explicit drop all that logs the attempt.
! You may wish to keep a second list (e.g. 2011) that does not
! log. During an attack, the additional logging can impact the
! performance of the router. Simply copy and paste access-list 2010,
! remove the log-input keyword, and name it access-list 2011. Then
! when an attack rages, you can replace access-list 2010 on the
! Internet-facing interface with access-list 2011.

! Block access to all but the loghost and the firewall, and log any
