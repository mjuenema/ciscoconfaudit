# Cisco Configuration Auditor (ciscoconfaudit)

**ciscoconfaudit** is a tool for auditing Cisco (and similar) configurations against a set of rules. It is an abstraction 
layer on top of the excellent [CiscoConfParse project](https://github.com/mpenning/ciscoconfparse).

**THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ABANDONED BUT I MIGHT NEED SOME FILES FOR ANOTHER PROJECT**
